* A supported copy of Windows 10/11
* Microsoft Visual Studio/Build Tools 2022 or later
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later
* .NET 6 or later

To compile the source tree for yourself, type in `run.cmd` from Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. By running `run.cmd`, you will also generate the NuGet packages. The output will be stored in 'Bin\Release'.
