# How to Build

If you want to build this project, there are a number of prerequisites you will need to have first before continuing.

* A supported copy of Windows 10
* Microsoft Visual Studio/Build Tools 2019 or later
* Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and later
* Windows Terminal (optional)

To compile the source tree for yourself, type in `run.cmd` from Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. By running `run.cmd`, you will also generate the NuGet packages. The output will be stored in 'Bin\Release'.
