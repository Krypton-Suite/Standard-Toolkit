# Development Workflow for the Standard Toolkit

This document is intended to assist development of the standard toolkit. The repository has **3** main branches. They are:-

* **alpha** - This branch contains active development code
* **canary** - Contains test code to be used by developers before the final release (has a 2 - 3 month cadence for feedback)
* **main** - The final public release code

Please bear in mind that there is a fourth branch, **signed** which is the same as **master** but with signed assemblies
